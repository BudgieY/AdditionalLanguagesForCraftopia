# FAQ

Q. The config file does not appear<br>
<br>
A. There might be a crash problem.<br>
   - If you have installed any other mods and they crash, the Mod Loader stop loading and cannot reach this mod.<br>
   - If you have installed XUnity.AutoTranslator, this mod is not compatible with it.<br>
   - If your Craftopia version and/or mod version is not appropriate, they can cause conflicts. This mod only supports stable version.<br>
   To specify the problem, see C:\Users\(Account Name)\AppData\LocalLow\PocketPair\Craftopia\Player.log.<br>
   The address is independent of Steam settings and always in Users.<br>
   Note that AppData is hidden by default and you have to change settings or write the path on the address bar.<br>
   After removing mods with problem or alpha setting, try to verify the integrity of your game files in Steam (see <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB/">Steam Help</a>).<br>
