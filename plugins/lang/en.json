  "600_NPCLine/335": "I've been doing a lot of research and it seems that 'that thing' was the foundation of a building that was significant in a past era.",
  "600_NPCLine/336": "...You've already figured it out, haven't you?\nThe reason I've asked you to collect various materials so far is to repair that thing. ",
  "600_NPCLine/337": "If we can repair that building, maybe we can revive the lost civilization that once lived on this continent.",
  "600_NPCLine/338": "While confirming my own theory,\nIt should also help you with the mission that God has bestowed on you. ",
  "600_NPCLine/339": "Now, get on with repairing the tower!",
  "600_NPCLine/34": "I'm not jealous of a [ITEM:00143][//silver-glider] at all ...",
  "600_NPCLine/340": "You can access the building from the panel at the top of the stairs.",
  "600_NPCLine/341": "Wonderful... You've successfully repaired the Tower!",
  "600_NPCLine/342": "There must be something still hidden in that tower...\nCould you please look into it? ",
  "600_NPCLine/343": "Oh right, you should take this.\nI found it near the ruins and it might be useful for something....",
  "600_NPCLine/344": "I think there is still something on top of the tower....",
  "600_NPCLine/345": "I see that you were able to unlock the secret hidden in the tower....\nWas that key the trigger....?",
  "600_NPCLine/346": "In that case... No, I'd like to thank you first.\nTake this with you, it's a vehicle excavated from the ruins. ",
  "600_NPCLine/347": "Treat it with care, because if you treat it roughly, it will break.\nBut as you restore more towers, you may eventually be able to make something like this one. Fufufu!",
  "600_NPCLine/348": "Come to think of it, there's one place I'm curious about...\nHave you been to the mountains in the southeast yet? ",
  "600_NPCLine/349": "If you follow the road up to the east of the village, you will find the 'ruins' where we were mining.\nThat's where we found the key.",
  "600_NPCLine/35": "I can fly a little with a [ITEM:00140][//stone-glider] too ...",
  "600_NPCLine/350": "Actually, there is a big 'gate' in the ruins,\nThat 'gate' apparently leads to a dungeon somewhere.",
  "600_NPCLine/351": "We went in for a bit to try it out, but it was complicated inside and there was a strong-looking monster at the very back.\nWe didn't think we could make it through.",
  "600_NPCLine/352": "As is often the case in fairy tales, strong monsters such as those are supposed to be guardians of some 'treasure'.",
  "600_NPCLine/353": "It won't be as easy as fighting goblins.\nYou will need to prepare carefully so\nI recommend crafting some new weapons and armor.",
  "600_NPCLine/354": "If you're under Lv7, I think you should prepare a little more.",
  "600_NPCLine/355": "...Did you defeat that ferocious monster?\nFufufu... As expected, you are just the person I hoped you would be. ",
  "600_NPCLine/356": "Actually, there are multiple towers other than the one in this plateau.\nI suspect there is a greater secret hidden in this land... ",
  "600_NPCLine/357": "Then we won't make much progress with our research just staying here.\nWe need to travel around and restore the towers!\n...Of course you'll come with me, right?",
  "600_NPCLine/358": "Well, now that we've decided that, let's make haste.\nI'm going to pack up my stuff and head to the next village.",
  "600_NPCLine/359": "Oh, don't forget to use the 'key' you got.\nWell then, I'll be waiting for you at Milwyn Hills. ",
  "600_NPCLine/36": "I won't do any pranks anymore so please forgive me!",
  "600_NPCLine/37": "When I was playing in the mountains, I found a place where you can excavate [ITEM:00706][//diamond]!",
  "600_NPCLine/38": "My [ITEM:00056][//stone-pickaxe] wasn't strong enough to excavate [ITEM:00706][//diamond] ...",
  "600_NPCLine/39": "Mom!",
  "600_NPCLine/4": "Welcome to the trial!!",
  "600_NPCLine/40": "I want [ITEM:00063][//platinum-pickaxe] ...",
  "600_NPCLine/41": "There must be an angel or god in the Island of Sky.",
  "600_NPCLine/410": "Hey, I've been waiting.\nBefore you came, I completed the investigation around here.\n…Fufufu, I don’t mind if you praise me for being a truly excellent scholar. ",
  "600_NPCLine/411": "You may have already noticed, but...\nThis area has become a goblin den.\nIt seems that the people of the village are in trouble. ",
  "600_NPCLine/412": "In order to get the villager's cooperation,\nBuilding friendly relationships will be essential.",
  "600_NPCLine/413": "From what I've heard, there is a lack of weapons,\nThey don't seem to have enough to stop the goblins from attacking.",
  "600_NPCLine/414": "According to my research, it seems that iron ore can be mined in abundance around here.\nBecause of that, you should supply the village with Iron One-Handed Swords and Iron Shields. ",
  "600_NPCLine/415": "You should be able to make Iron One-Handed Swords and Iron Shields by now.\n...Unless you forgot to use the key to the plateau.",
  "600_NPCLine/416": "Iron ore is all around this village, so if you walk around a bit, you should be able to find it.",
  "600_NPCLine/417": "Have you prepared the weapons?...Hmm, they're of good quality.\nThe people of the village will be happy with this. ",
  "600_NPCLine/418": "Alright, I'll pass them on.\nI'm sure they'll be happy when they learn that you have helped them out.",
  "600_NPCLine/419": "By the way, while you were making weapons, I checked the structure of the tower.",
  "600_NPCLine/42": "Angel! God!",
  "600_NPCLine/420": "Apparently, this tower is strongly influenced by the biome around here.\nIn other words, it seems that \"material derived from this land\" is needed.",
  "600_NPCLine/421": "Well, they can all be sourced around this hilly area.\nI've given you a rough idea of the habitat area.\nPlease look around in the areas I've marked.",
  "600_NPCLine/422": "I only need one to for my analysis...\nYou will probably use it too. I recommend you keep a few.",
  "600_NPCLine/423": "If you can't find it, open the map and take a closer look.",
  "600_NPCLine/424": "1, 2, 3... hmm, looks like they're all there.",
  "600_NPCLine/425": "I thought this would be quicker with you having made it this far. Fufufu.",
  "600_NPCLine/426": "Now then, let's get down to business.\nI've had you wander around the area collecting items, and I'm sure you've seen...",
  "600_NPCLine/427": "Did you see a large goblin village south of this village?\nOriginally, it seems that there were only a few goblins,\nThe number has increased greatly, and now it seems like that.",
  "600_NPCLine/428": "The villagers seem to be doing their best to protect the village,\nAs long as they are outnumbered, they will continue to suffer.\n…So, I wanted to give them that “thank you”. ",
  "600_NPCLine/429": "We need you to sneak into their settlements.\nAnd I'd like you to 'borrow' a bit of the 'goblin treasure' that's hidden somewhere.\nCan you 'borrow' some of it?\"",
  "600_NPCLine/43": "I wonder how you can get to the Island of Sky?",
  "600_NPCLine/430": "It's a matter of stance, you know. If you don't fight back, you'll be taken advantage of. That's why if we show our \"gratitude\", I'm sure they should come to understand.",
  "600_NPCLine/431": "There is an old saying.\n'The only people you can shoot are those who are prepared to be shot.'\nSo...It's up to you!",
  "600_NPCLine/432": "It's \"goblin treasure\" ... of course it's in a treasure chest.",
  "600_NPCLine/433": "Excellent! Just as I'd hoped!\nThey can't go too far if we are holding something important hostage... or 'borrowing' it, can they?\"",
  "600_NPCLine/434": "Negotiations are not just about talking.\nEverything has to be balanced. ",
  "600_NPCLine/435": "There were creatures other than goblins in the settlement?\nThat is concerning... ",
  "600_NPCLine/436": "Now, speaking of balance, now that the south has been cleared up, we now need to clear up the problem in the north.",
  "600_NPCLine/437": "Actually, there are goblins living in the 'Abandoned Castle' in the north.\n…But unlike the guys in the south, they don't attack this village. ",
  "600_NPCLine/438": "Because they seem to be getting all sorts of supplies from the dungeon at the back of that 'abandoned castle'.\nI guess it's more efficient than having to travel to the village.",
  "600_NPCLine/439": "There are two problems.\nThe first is that the goblins won't just let you investigate the abandoned castle.\nThe second is rumors of a powerful monster in the deepest part of the dungeon.",
  "600_NPCLine/44": "We're gonna try and get a big game today as well!",
  "600_NPCLine/440": "He seems to be the leader of the warriors who once guarded the ruined castle,\nIt seems that now everyone who enters the ruined castle is dragged into the underworld.\n…How can you sleep well with a monster like that nearby?",
  "600_NPCLine/441": "So, I'm going to ask you to do one ghost-killing job for me.\nI'm sure there's a key sealed deep in the dungeon.\nThat shouldn't be a bad deal for you.",
  "600_NPCLine/442": "However, you should be careful...the enemies of the ruined castle are formidable.\nThat's right... you should be at least Lv. 15.",
  "600_NPCLine/443": "The enemies in the ruined castle are formidable. If you're around Lv20, you should be fine.",
  "600_NPCLine/444": "Fufufu... incredible... you've exceeded my expectations!\nLooks like you got the key too, didn't you?",
  "600_NPCLine/445": "Now, once you have the key, there is only one thing to do.\nIs the tower restored?",
  "600_NPCLine/446": "You're going to use that key quickly to open up a new era.",
  "600_NPCLine/447": "What's going on? ...Don't tell me that the tower hasn't been restored yet?",
  "600_NPCLine/448": "It seems that the evolution of the era has been completed.",
  "600_NPCLine/449": "New technology drives the development of culture.\nThe air of stagnation that had spread over this land for a long time\nIt may change with your success. ",
  "600_NPCLine/45": "Our target is [ITEM:02201][//whale-shark]!",
  "600_NPCLine/450": "…If you just want to evolve the era,\nWouldn't it be better if we didn't have to kill the goblins?",
  "600_NPCLine/451": "Hahaha! What are you talking about!\nIf there are people in the way, my investigation will not go well, right? ",
  "600_NPCLine/452": "Now, our next destination is the Yarden Meadow, which stretches out ahead of us.\nIt's the largest area in the land. Be ready for it.\nI'll be on my way once I've completed my research.",
  "600_NPCLine/46": "I can't die without catching a [ITEM:02201][//whale-shark]!",
  "600_NPCLine/460": "Hey, I've been waiting.\n…how did you manage to break through hordes of goblins and giant monsters?\nFufufu, there's a secret path.",
  "600_NPCLine/461": "I've searched around a bit, but I haven't seen any on the plateaus or hills.\nNew monsters also seem to live in this area.\nQuite interesting... ",
  "600_NPCLine/462": "I would like to proceed with the investigation, but there are problems.\nThe people living here believe in living in harmony with nature.\nIt's like a hunting tribe in the mountains. ",
  "600_NPCLine/463": "Apparently they don't really like interacting with outsiders.\nI also have trouble with new people.",
  "600_NPCLine/464": "Fufufu, don't worry. I've already researched the solution.\nIn their customs, \"being a hunter\" seems to be a mark of a full-fledged person. ",
  "600_NPCLine/465": "If we prove to be good hunters.\nThey won't be able to dissuade us.",
  "600_NPCLine/466": "From here, cross the river and go west, at the edge of the cliff\nIt seems that there is a \"fortress protected by giants\".\nDefeating the giant and bringing back the treasure he protects seems to be the \"Hunter's Ritual\".",
  "600_NPCLine/467": "The fort seems to be home to goblins as well...\nWell, you should be fine.\nI asked for this place for \"my research\". ",
  "600_NPCLine/468": "Anyway, this grass is huge...\nIt's quite a distance to the fort, too. You have to make use of vehicles.",
  "600_NPCLine/469": "How's it going, did you get your proof?\nHmm, as expected, you are now a full-fledged hunter in both name and reality.",
  "600_NPCLine/47": "Location and equipment are important in fishing!",
  "600_NPCLine/470": "Well, now that I'm recognised as a hunter too, I'll have to ingratiate myself.\n...What's that look in your eyes?",
  "600_NPCLine/471": "From a scholarly point of view,\nThis settlement is ill-prepared for the plague.\nSo I'm going to prepare an \"antidote\" for them. ",
  "600_NPCLine/472": "There's a 'poison swamp' just in the vicinity, perhaps due to a change in the nearby crust.\nThere should be no shortage of mushrooms to use as ingredients.\nGo and procure a few ingredients for me.",
  "600_NPCLine/473": "The antidote is made from poisonous mushrooms.\nIt's like using poison to control poison. ",
  "600_NPCLine/474": "Mm, this many mushrooms should be enough.\nI'll take care of mixing the antidote.",
  "600_NPCLine/475": "...there were mutated goblins that were different from the goblin settlements?\nHmmm... maybe the geology has some effect on goblin ecology...",
  "600_NPCLine/476": "More importantly, there was a little trouble while you were out...\nIt seems that bandits broke in and tried to steal the chief's treasure. ",
  "600_NPCLine/477": "Apparently they were able to drive them away before anything was stolen,\nPeople have been getting worked up that they're going to come back though.",
  "600_NPCLine/478": "The bandit's name is 'Kevin' and he is said to be hiding in the eastern forest.\nI want you to find him somehow and punish him with your own hands.",
  "600_NPCLine/479": "I marked the approximate location of the forest,\nI don't know where it actually is... I want you to find it somehow. ",
  "600_NPCLine/48": "That old son of a bitch ...",
  "600_NPCLine/480": "I told you it was important to hit back at the goblins, didn't I?\nThis will make them go away for a while.\n... but he's not the kind of guy who learns his lesson, so I don't think he'll change his ways.",
  "600_NPCLine/481": "Now then, shall we begin the restoration of the tower in earnest?\nThe tower here also seems to have the same basic structure as the tower on the hill. ",
  "600_NPCLine/482": "In other words, it seems that 'materials derived from this land' are necessary.\nIt looks like there's one around the northern lake and one in the woods you mentioned earlier. ",
  "600_NPCLine/483": "It's about you. You may have already restored the tower,\nI also need a small amount for my research.\nThink of it as an investment in the future and secure some.",
  "600_NPCLine/484": "For the sake of \"our\" research, I'm begging you!",
  "600_NPCLine/485": "Great, you're a really good assistant!\nIf the tower hasn't been restored yet, you should finish it. ",
  "600_NPCLine/486": "Yes, while you've been running around.\nI've tracked down the location of that key.",
  "600_NPCLine/487": "I heard from the villagers,\nThere seems to be a dungeon in the cliffs southeast of this village.",
  "600_NPCLine/488": "There's a monster called 'Lizard Gunner' who has a stronghold there.\nIt is probably the one that sealed the key.",
  "600_NPCLine/489": "You should prepare well and then go.",
  "600_NPCLine/49": "But I can't just repair it myself ...",
  "600_NPCLine/490": "rom my point of view, yes...\nIf you're around Lv25, you'll be fine. ",
  "600_NPCLine/491": "I see you got the key safely.\n... but it doesn't look like it's going to be business as usual.",
  "600_NPCLine/492": "It seems security is stronger than before,\nApparently, we need another kind of key to open up new technologies.",
  "600_NPCLine/493": "I guess we need to go a bit further into the meadow.",
  "600_NPCLine/494": "Up ahead is the Scavenger Nest.\nIt's a roost for those who dig up ruins and trade relics of the past.",
  "600_NPCLine/495": "...Maybe they are to blame for the stranger-hatred of the people in this village.",
  "600_NPCLine/496": "Anyway, I'm planning to head there once the investigation around here is complete.\nYou can go ahead of me as usual.",
  "600_NPCLine/5": "I'm so sleepy!",
  "600_NPCLine/50": "Why am I so unlucky!",
  "600_NPCLine/500": "Hey, I've been waiting for you. This is the scavenger nest.\nIt's full of unusual stuff, dug up from all over the land.",
  "600_NPCLine/501": "Well, from their point of view, we're the unusual ones.\nNo, a nuisance, would be more correct.",
  "600_NPCLine/502": "It's the same as when you came to the village of the beginning.\nIt seems that no settlement can afford to take care of \"useless outsiders\". ",
  "600_NPCLine/503": "Then we do what we must!\nThey're calculating people. As soon as they see that we can supply what they need, they'll warm up to us.",
  "600_NPCLine/504": "Machines are essential to their lives...\n'scrap parts' and 'electronic components' must be a necessity for them.",
  "600_NPCLine/505": "Prepare 20 of each and give them to the villagers.\nThen they will know that we are 'polite guests'.",
  "600_NPCLine/506": "How's it going? Have you got your gift ready?",
  "600_NPCLine/507": "All right, these parts should be enough.",
  "600_NPCLine/508": "By the way, you may have already seen it, but there's lava spewing out to the south of this settlement.\nIt looks like a small 'volcanic biome' is forming.",
  "600_NPCLine/509": "And apparently the geology is affecting the surrounding goblins,\nThey are causing mutations, as we saw in the Poison Swamp.",
  "600_NPCLine/51": "It gets less durable even if I repair it, so maybe I should get a new weapon ...",
  "600_NPCLine/510": "They would make very interesting research subjects.\nI want you to retrieve combat data from each goblin. ",
  "600_NPCLine/511": "Because it's affected by volcanoes,\nNaturally, you have to be careful about fire.",
  "600_NPCLine/512": "Because it's affected by volcanoes,\nNaturally, you have to be careful about fire.",
  "600_NPCLine/513": "Good, it looks like you've gathered your battle data.",
  "600_NPCLine/514": "Perhaps there are other monsters that have mutated due to changes in the biomes.",
  "600_NPCLine/515": "Take care when encountering them.",
  "600_NPCLine/516": "Well, it seems your gift worked,\nThe information gathering here is going well.\nThanks to you, we've heard some very interesting stories.",
  "600_NPCLine/517": "You've seen the ruins to the east, haven't you?\nI've heard about an 'ancient relic' that lies there.",
  "600_NPCLine/518": "Something with information recorded before the collapse of civilisation due to the 'Great Destruction',\nBut it's not that simple, apparently.",
  "600_NPCLine/519": "There seems to be a stone slab hidden around the ruins...\nI tried to get a glance at it from the top of the cliff,\nBut all I could see were Gigantes and goblins swarming. ",
  "600_NPCLine/52": "[ITEM_FAMILY:15101][//glider]'s great!",
  "600_NPCLine/520": "It seems that several scavengers have lost their lives while trying to excavate the area to get rich quick.",
  "600_NPCLine/521": "Anyway, to find out what happened in the past,\nI want to secure it somehow. ",
  "600_NPCLine/522": "I've confirmed the location of the clue.\nI want you to find the hidden treasures.",
  "600_NPCLine/523": "The treasure can be found by following the clues on the stone tablet.\nIt seems that there are several stone tablets though. Look for them carefully.",
  "600_NPCLine/524": "Did you find it!\nCome on, show me!",
  "600_NPCLine/525": "…",
  "600_NPCLine/526": "…What is this?\nA machine similar to the one in the towers...?",
  "600_NPCLine/527": "Hmm... I'll need to research this further.",
  "600_NPCLine/528": "Anyway, while you're looking for treasure\nI was able to locate the key. ",
  "600_NPCLine/529": "Did you see that there was a dungeon at the foot of the waterfall in the depths of the ruins?",
  "600_NPCLine/53": "I want to be a bird!",
  "600_NPCLine/530": "This time, the 'griffon' that lives in that one seems to be guarding the key.",
  "600_NPCLine/531": "Speaking of Griffons, \"the ruler of the skies\",\nIt will, of course, attack from the air. ",
  "600_NPCLine/532": "Unlike the enemies so far, it seems that countermeasures are needed.",
  "600_NPCLine/533": "But... it's somewhat disturbing that a griffon that is said to originally rules the skies\nis inside a dungeon...",
  "600_NPCLine/534": "But... it's somewhat disturbing that a griffon that is said to originally rules the skies\nis inside a dungeon...",
  "600_NPCLine/535": "Anyway, we now have two keys.\nThis should allow us to release the technology.",
  "600_NPCLine/536": "As usual, we will rebuild the tower and release new technologies.",
  "600_NPCLine/537": "Like the previous tower, it seems that \"material derived from this land\" is needed.",
  "600_NPCLine/538": "One seems to be able to be collected on the archeological site and the other on the west hill.\nWell, this area is familiar, I can't say anything anymore.",
  "600_NPCLine/539": "Complete the tower and unlock new technologies!",
  "600_NPCLine/54": "I'm training my body so I have more stamina!",
  "600_NPCLine/540": "It seems that one of the \"materials originating from this land\" can be collected in the ruins and the other in the western hills.",
  "600_NPCLine/541": "As expected, this is all that is left of this meadow tower.\nNew technologies will be brought to this region...",
  "600_NPCLine/542": "...the hunter-gatherers had their own culture.\nHow will their lives change as new technologies are brought to them?",
  "600_NPCLine/543": "We live by the customs of our ancestors.\nIs it a good thing that this way of life is changing or...",
  "600_NPCLine/544": "Well, it's not our place to question their customs or how they might change.\nLet's move on to the next area.",
  "600_NPCLine/545": "Next is the Owatatsu Islands.\nIt's a region with a unique culture, surrounded by the sea and made up of several islands.",
  "600_NPCLine/546": "I'm planning to head there once the investigation around here is complete.\nAs always, you should go ahead first. ",
  "600_NPCLine/55": "I want to fly away from here!",
  "600_NPCLine/550": "Hey, I've been waiting.\nThis is Owatatsu Island village.\nAs you can see... the culture is very different from the meadows. ",
  "600_NPCLine/551": "Alas, we'll have to do the same as usual first.\nFirst and foremost, we will need to give them a gift to earn their trust.",
  "600_NPCLine/552": "They take their culture very seriously.\nLet them know that we respect them too. ",
  "600_NPCLine/553": "A gift in line with their culture,\nCan you go and get me an 'Eastern-style field umbrella' and an 'Eastern-style floor desk'?",
  "600_NPCLine/554": "The 'cherry blossom petals' required for the material are unique to this region.\nIf you cut down the \"Sakura\", you will get it. ",
  "600_NPCLine/555": "Mhmm, good work.\nThis will make them happy. ",
  "600_NPCLine/556": "As usual, leave the sweet-talking to me.",
  "600_NPCLine/557": "Alright then, I've got a request for you already.\nIt seems that piracy is rampant in the area, due to the fact that the area is surrounded by water.",
  "600_NPCLine/558": "The problem seems to be that the pirates disappears.\nEven when the villagers go out to attack the lair, they cannot find any pirates,\nThey also only seem to appear at night.",
  "600_NPCLine/559": "I've marked the places where piracy frequently occurs.\nWould you be willing to investigate and take them down?",
  "600_NPCLine/56": "But I need the mechanical power to be able to fly further ...",
  "600_NPCLine/560": "They say the pirates only attack at night ...\nIf you can't find any, you might want to try going at a different time.",
  "600_NPCLine/561": "Did you find those pirates?\n...I see, they're skeletons.\nNo wonder they disappeared.",
  "600_NPCLine/562": "To repeat the act of plunder even in death...\nI won't deny that the existence of skeletons and their ecology is intriguing.",
  "600_NPCLine/563": "Now that we've cleared up the problem... let's get down to the main task of finding where the key is.",
  "600_NPCLine/564": "I investigated the traditions around here, and several references to a monster caught my attention.",
  "600_NPCLine/565": "It is said that there is a legend in this area from ancient times of a serpent with eight heads.",
  "600_NPCLine/566": "In order to defeat it, you need the 'Three Sacred Treasures',\nIt seems that we will need items native to this region. ",
  "600_NPCLine/567": "I've done some research on the approximate whereabouts,\nBut it's based on an old legend...\nWell, it's your job to do the actual field research. I'm counting on you!",
  "600_NPCLine/568": "At least it's definitely in the area around the marked area.\nYou'll have to look around.",
  "600_NPCLine/569": "It looks like you found three sacred treasures.",
  "600_NPCLine/57": "A product made of better quality ore performs much better than something made of low quality ore.",
  "600_NPCLine/570": "...they're all in shambles... but perhaps this will be enough.",
  "600_NPCLine/571": "Now, we are ready. Time to take down that serpent.",
  "600_NPCLine/572": "It seems that the three sacred treasures are used to summon the serpent.\nI will take care of this.",
  "600_NPCLine/573": "It seems to appear around a small isolated island in the east.\nI want you to head over there take down the serpent!",
  "600_NPCLine/574": "… Hahaha, you are physical labor, and I am a brain labor.\nDid you decide to be in charge at the beginning of the village? Do you remember?",
  "600_NPCLine/575": "It looks like you successfully defeated the 8-headed serpent!",
  "600_NPCLine/576": "What... eight-legged... was it perhaps... a Kraken?",
  "600_NPCLine/577": "...these kind of stories,\nSometimes they are passed on to future generations in a different form.\nIt can happen.",
  "600_NPCLine/578": "No, it's okay because I was thinking about the possibility of another monster for such a time ...!",
  "600_NPCLine/579": "It's more likely that the 'Noble Frog' residing in the eastern dungeon is guarding the key.\"",
  "600_NPCLine/58": "I can't run like I used to ...",
  "600_NPCLine/580": "I took a quick look, and it seems the dungeon has changed a lot.\nBe careful and have a proper strategy.",
  "600_NPCLine/581": "If you said a serpent with eight heads and a frog, you would think it was the serpent...?",
  "600_NPCLine/582": "I see you have succeeded in defeating the Noble Frog!\n...hmmm.",
  "600_NPCLine/583": "Apparently, just like the meadows, this key alone can't be used to unlock technology.",
  "600_NPCLine/584": "There seems to be another key somewhere ...",
  "600_NPCLine/585": "I don't know where it is at the moment.\nI want a little time to investigate.",
  "600_NPCLine/586": "I'll let you know as soon as I find out where we're going next.\nWait a little longer until the investigation is complete.",
  "600_NPCLine/587": "*This is the end of the quests that have been released so far.",
  "600_NPCLine/588": "Probably in the walled 'Brigandine Valley', judging from the location of the towers...",
  "600_NPCLine/589": "That's a dangerous area in the centre of the continent, let's head there but keep our wits about us...",
  "600_NPCLine/59": "I used to be a blacksmith.",
  "600_NPCLine/590": "Probably from the location of the towers,\nThe next destination would be in that walled 'Brigandine Valley'...",
  "600_NPCLine/591": "That's a dangerous area in the centre of the continent, let's head there but keep our wits about us...",
  "600_NPCLine/592": "I will be on my way once I have completed my investigation of the area.\nYou can go ahead of me as usual.",

  "600_NPCLine/600": "Well, I was waiting.\nThis is the village of the Brigan Dine Valley.",
  "600_NPCLine/601": "Apparently, the castle in the center of this area is occupied by monsters.\nThanks to this, it seems that the battle has continued in this area.",
  "600_NPCLine/602": "It seems that some people in the village are sacrificed ...\nWe would like to help us at least for the recovery of the relics.",
  "600_NPCLine/603": "I checked the point where there was a battle.\nI want you to check the marked area and collect the relics.",
  "600_NPCLine/604": "The relics should be left around the mark. I asked.",
  "600_NPCLine/605": "It seems that you have been able to collect it, and the people in the village will surely be pleased.",
  "600_NPCLine/606": "I was investigating this area, but people were consumed so intense.\nI want to make at least warm dishes and have my physical strength ...",
  "600_NPCLine/607": "Yes, Jack Lanterns live around here.\nYou should get a \"pumpkin\" by defeating them.",
  "600_NPCLine/608": "If you use that, you should be able to cook them with physical strength.\nCan you collect \"pumpkin scrap\"?",
  "600_NPCLine/609": "Do you use monsters for cooking ...?\n… Well, it's not us to eat.",
  "600_NPCLine/61": "I told you I can't run anymore ...!",
  "600_NPCLine/610": "It looks like you gathered safely. Please leave the food to me.",
  "600_NPCLine/611": "The listening has been completed while you are collecting items.\nWould you like to move to work in earnest?",
  "600_NPCLine/612": "According to a survey by me, the entrance to the dungeon where the key is sealed seems to be in the castle.",
  "600_NPCLine/613": "And the problem is how to rush into the castle.",
  "600_NPCLine/614": "I checked the route to the castle, but the trouble was that the dragon was sitting on the plains along the way.\nHow to reject him will be the first barrier.",
  "600_NPCLine/615": "As a result of the people around here, working several times to defeat\nThe dragon seems to be consuming considerably.",
  "600_NPCLine/616": "Defeat the dragon with our hands and open a breakthrough into the castle.",
  "600_NPCLine/617": "Are you fighting yourself?\nHaha ... If you care about the details, you can't achieve your mission?",
  "600_NPCLine/618": "Alright, you seem to have succeeded in defeating the dragon.\nThe dragons in this area are all weak.\nEven if you come back, let's deal with it in the same way.",
  "600_NPCLine/619": "Now, the breakthrough is opened. Let's say you proceed to the dungeon in the hall.",
  "600_NPCLine/62": "But thanks to [ITEM:00644][//belt-conveyor] and [ITEM:02005][//large-pot], I'm still able to continue cooking.",
  "600_NPCLine/620": "… But, a lot of goblins should be ambushed in the castle.\nPlease be careful.",
  "600_NPCLine/621": "The key is like an executioner called \"Monsieur de Brigan Dine\".",
  "600_NPCLine/622": "An extremely ferocious enemy with an ax in both hands, the attack will be fierce.\nIt is better to go after firmly solidifying the defense.",
  "600_NPCLine/623": "A considerable number of goblins should be waiting in the hall. I want you to proceed while being careful.",
  "600_NPCLine/624": "You seem to have succeeded in subjugation.\nThe executioners seem to have no shape in front of you.",
  "600_NPCLine/625": "Alright, this should have been the key to evolution.\nBuild a tower and open new technologies.",
  "600_NPCLine/626": "The materials required for the tower recovery should be able to be collected near here.\nPlease do your best and collect it.",
  "600_NPCLine/627": "It looks like you have succeeded in opening a new technology.\nAlright, it seems that you can reproduce the road that the former civilization has followed smoothly.",
  "600_NPCLine/628": "… One thing to worry about is that as a result of opening the technology as it is\nWill I be going to follow the same history again?",
  "600_NPCLine/629": "If you follow the same history\nI wonder if \"big destruction\" will occur again ...",
  "600_NPCLine/63": "Welcome to the paradise, Craftopia! Let's lead humanity from zero to utopia ",
  "600_NPCLine/630": "Well, I can't help thinking about this.\nLet's say that we will continue to investigate.",
  "600_NPCLine/631": "By the way, next is ... Sharbad iceberg, located in the southeast, will be the destination.",
  "600_NPCLine/632": "I'm not good at being cold ...\nIt's for the investigation, there's no way.",
  "600_NPCLine/633": "I will be heading once the survey around this area is completed.\nPlease go ahead as usual.",
  "600_NPCLine/64": "Why... Must we fight...?",
  "600_NPCLine/640": "Yeah, oh ... I was waiting ...\nThis is ... the village of \"Charbert Icezan\" ...",
  "600_NPCLine/641": "Say ... it's cold ...! ! !",
  "600_NPCLine/642": "You shouldn't be able to endure ...! straight away…! I have to prepare items that can withstand the cold ...!",
  "600_NPCLine/643": "And, \"Helpepper\" should be growing in the lava areas born of crustal deformation on the Yarden Meadow...!",
  "600_NPCLine/644": "Use it to make a \"freeze register potion\" in a hurry ...!",
  "600_NPCLine/645": "No ... eyelids ...",
  "600_NPCLine/646": "I was waiting, it was late.",
  "600_NPCLine/647": "I'm sorry ... I guess I couldn't see it, the people in the village divided the registry potion ...",
  "600_NPCLine/648": "In cold regions, it is difficult to activate without equipment with this potion or cold resistance.\nYou are ready to be ready.",
  "600_NPCLine/649": "As you may have noticed, this village looks like a crashed airship.\nThis is also a heritage of past civilization.",
  "600_NPCLine/65": "Attack with [KEYMAP:MELEE]. When collecting wood or stone, you can hold as well.",
  "600_NPCLine/650": "And the people here are living with this crash\nHe seems to be trying to repair it.",
  "600_NPCLine/651": "I'm not interested in repairing the crash ship,\nIn the unlikely event that the repair of the heritage is successful, it should be useful for past research.",
  "600_NPCLine/652": "There are several parts required for repair.",
  "600_NPCLine/653": "Machines for repair should be able to be collected from the \"rotation saw returned to the field\" around here.",
  "600_NPCLine/654": "For some parts that can't be replaced, you have to collect scattered things.\nI set out where the parts would probably have fallen.",
  "600_NPCLine/655": "I think it will be a difficult search, but I would like to ask.",
  "600_NPCLine/656": "However, it was such a wilderness that was so wild ...",
  "600_NPCLine/657": "The rotating saws dug out in the beginning of the village had gone somewhere soon ...",
  "600_NPCLine/658": "The circuit broke down at one time for the missing saws that became missing\nI guess this will come to attack people ...",
  "600_NPCLine/659": "Apparently I found the parts and this.\nLet's pray that the crash ship will be restored.",
  "600_NPCLine/66": "As long as we follow Krael, we do not need to think for ourselves. ",
  "600_NPCLine/660": "While I was looking for parts, I also investigated the key.",
  "600_NPCLine/661": "There seems to be a dungeon on the summit of this iceberg.\nIt is like an ice wolf called \"Fenrir\" that protects it.",
  "600_NPCLine/662": "An enemy who uses ice. It's a good idea to get ready.",
  "600_NPCLine/663": "An enemy who uses ice. It's a good idea to get ready.",

  "600_NPCLine/674": "The north is a desert and lava area.\nThe opposite of this area will surely need a \"heat resisting potion\".\nIt's about preparing with chitin and then heading.",
